                At Pro Health and Fitness, I applied my skills from Flatiron School by creating web applications to meet business needs through technology. 
                My first applications, which utilized QR codes, resulted in a 100% growth in Google reviews. 
                The QR code application played a crucial role in streamlining the google review process for patients, 
                leading to a significant increase in positive reviews for all 4 clinics under ProHealth and Fitness management.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>‣</span>
                I developed the Pro Health and Fitness PDF Repository as my second application, aiming to streamline and optimize document management for the organization.
                 This innovative solution significantly expedited the authorization process for physical & occupational therapists by an impressive 45%. Additionally, 
                it substantially reduced the administrative staff's time spent searching for PDFs, resulting in an astounding 80% decrease in search efforts. 
                By leveraging this application, Pro Health and Fitness witnessed remarkable efficiency gains and improved workflow across the board.

                   During my time at Flatiron School, I had the opportunity to
                   immerse myself in a fast-paced 15-week program, where I learned
                   the ins and outs of JavaScript, React JS, Ruby and Ruby on
                   Rails.
              </p>
              <p>
                   <span>‣</span>
                   Through various group projects and individual assignments,I
                   honed my skills in building dynamic web applications, utilizing
                   React and Ruby on Rails to create both the front-end and
                   back-end of the application.
              </p>

                    <span>‣</span>
                    By the end of the program, I felt confident in my abilities to
                    use these technologies in real-world situations and confident in
                    my abilities to learn new languages as well.
